# Project Portfolio  

This repository highlights practical IT & Cybersecurity projects that demonstrate my skills in networking, system administration, and security.  
Each project showcases hands-on experience I've gained over the past two years and shows how I could apply these skills in real world scenarios.

## My Work:  

- **[Attacking & Defending Test Exercise](Attacking%20&%20Defending%20Test%20Exercise.pdf)**  
   In this project I built and hardened a Ubuntu server with tools like **ClamAV**, **Chkrootkit**, and **Lynis** to detect malware and misconfigurations. I configured **CSF firewall rules** and then launched attacks from Kali Linux using **Hydra** (SSH brute force) and **Nmap** scans. Following this I monitored system activity with **Security Onion**, escalating alerts into a case for investigation.  
  *Skills demonstrated: system hardening, penetration testing, log analysis, and intrusion detection.*  

- **[Internal Network Penetration & Vulnerability Assessment](Internal%20Network%20Penetration%20&%20Vulnerability%20Assessment.pdf)**  
  In this project I carried out a vulnerability assessment on a remote host using **Nmap** to identify outdated services (OpenSSH, Apache, MySQL). Researched CVEs, I then used **Armitage** in Kali Linux to exploit weaknesses and gain access, retrieved sensitive information from the compromised system and tested defense by applying static routing and **ACLs in Packet Tracer** to restrict traffic and block HTTP/ICMP from specific networks.  
  *Skills demonstrated: vulnerability scanning, CVE research, exploitation, and defensive network configuration.*  


- **[The Importance of Encryption](The%20Importance%20of%20Encryption.pdf)**  
     In this project I explored how encryption protects the way we communicate with web pages and how sensitive our data can be. I encrypted files with **GPG**, hid data in images using **Steghide**, and secured browsing with **ProtonVPN**. I also compared **HTTP vs HTTPS** traffic in Wireshark, configured **SSH/SFTP** for secure remote access, and set up **WPA2 with MAC filtering** to protect wireless networks.  
  *Skills demonstrated: encryption, secure communication, VPN tunneling, and Wi-Fi security.*
