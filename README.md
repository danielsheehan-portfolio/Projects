<p align="center">
I’m an Information Technology & Cybersecurity student in MTU Cork with a strong interest in networking, cybersecurity, and IT Operations.  
I’ve primarily gained hands-on experience through projects involving system hardening, penetration testing, and secure network design for both Linux and Winodws. I also have experience working with ADDS, DNS, DHCP and WSUS in Windows Server environments.

This repository highlights practical IT & Cybersecurity projects that demonstrate my skills in networking, system administration, and security. Each project showcases hands-on experience I've gained over the past two years and shows how I could apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

<h2 align="center">My Independent Projects</h2>


- **[Attacking & Defending Test Exercise](Attacking%20&%20Defending%20Test%20Exercise.pdf)**  
  In this project I built and hardened a Ubuntu server with tools like **ClamAV, Chkrootkit, and Lynis** to detect malware and misconfigurations. I configured **CSF firewall rules** and then launched attacks from Kali Linux using **Hydra** (SSH brute force) and **Nmap** scans. Following this I monitored system activity with **Security Onion**, escalating alerts into a case for investigation.  
  *Skills demonstrated: system hardening, penetration testing, log analysis, and intrusion detection.*

- **[Internal Network Penetration & Vulnerability Assessment](Internal%20Network%20Penetration%20&%20Vulnerability%20Assessment.pdf)**  
  In this project I carried out a vulnerability assessment on a remote host using **Nmap** to identify outdated services (OpenSSH, Apache, MySQL in my case). Next I researched Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, I then used **Armitage** in Kali Linux to exploit weaknesses and gain access, retrieved sensitive information from the compromised system and tested defense by applying static routing and **ACLs in Packet Tracer** to restrict traffic and block HTTP/ICMP from specific networks.  
  *Skills demonstrated: vulnerability scanning, CVE research, exploitation, and defensive network configuration.*

---

- **[The Importance of Encryption](The%20Importance%20of%20Encryption.pdf)**  
  In this project I explored how encryption protects the way we communicate with web pages and how sensitive our data can be. I encrypted files with **GPG**, hid data in images using **Steghide**, and secured browsing with **ProtonVPN**. I also compared **HTTP vs HTTPS** traffic in Wireshark, configured **SSH/SFTP** for secure remote access, and set up **WPA2 with MAC filtering** to protect wireless networks.  
  *Skills demonstrated: encryption, secure communication, VPN tunneling, and Wi-Fi security.*

<h2 align="center">MTU Coursework Projects</h2>



 
- **[Windows Security](Windows%20Security%20Assignment%20Daniel%20Sheehan%20Submission.pdf)**  
  Developed and executed PowerShell scripts to analyze security event logs, monitor processes, and enforce access control policies in a Windows Server environment.  
  *Skills demonstrated: PowerShell scripting, Windows system administration, access control, and event log analysis.*  

---  

- **[Internet & Network Services](Internet%20Network%20Services%20Assignment%20Daniel%20Sheehan%20Submission.pdf)**  
  Designed and implemented a multi-service Linux network across three virtual machines, configuring **DNS (BIND9)**, **DHCP**, **SSH**, **Apache with Ruby on Rails**, **Postfix/Dovecot mail**, **iSCSI storage**, **CUPS printing**, and a **Cockpit management server**. Validated connectivity, redundancy, and service functionality across the subnet.  
  *Skills demonstrated: Linux server administration, service configuration, networking, troubleshooting, and system integration.*
